# Ray Tracing 3D Editor 

This project is a simple graphical application implementing **ray tracing** for photorealistic rendering of 3D scenes.  

## Features
- Basic ray tracing renderer (CPU)
- Simple 3D scene editor
- Interactive manipulation of scene objects
- Photorealistic rendering principles

## Technologies
- **Language:** C / C++
- **Rendering:** Ray Tracing
- **GUI:** (e.g. ImGui / custom GUI)

## Goal
To design, implement, and test a simple 3D editor using ray tracing techniques and to study existing ray tracing algorithms and tools.

## Project Status
🚧 **Work in Progress**

This project is currently under active development as part of a bachelor thesis.  
Features, structure, and implementation details may change.
